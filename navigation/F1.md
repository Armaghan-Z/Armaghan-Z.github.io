## My Formula 1 Journey

<div>

## My Favorite Team: Ferrari 🏁

<p>There’s something about the iconic red cars that has always captured my heart. Ferrari is more than just a team; it’s a symbol of passion, legacy, and determination. The Prancing Horse has been a dominant force in Formula 1 for decades, winning numerous World Constructors' Championships.</p>

<p>I admire Ferrari not only for their past glories but also for their constant drive to be the best. Every race weekend, I cheer them on, hoping to see that red car cross the finish line first. Forza Ferrari!</p>

## Favorite Driver: Lewis Hamilton 🏆

<p>Despite being a Ferrari fan, my favorite driver is none other than the seven-time World Champion, <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong>. His talent, determination, and relentless pursuit of greatness make him an inspiration both on and off the track.</p>

<p>From breaking records to advocating for equality, Hamilton has proven time and again that he’s not just a phenomenal driver, but a powerful force for positive change in the world. His battles on the track, especially with Ferrari, are thrilling to watch, but no matter the outcome, he has my respect.</p>
